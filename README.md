# Brain Encoding Models using Taskonomy

## Background and Objectives
This project compares encoding models using Taskonomy. The assignment consists of two main problems, each with specific sub-tasks:
- Problem 1: RSA and stimulus dependence: Compute and analyze a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) matrix using Taskonomy networks and BOLD5000 stimuli data.
- Problem 2: Testing an asymmetric distance: Build encoding models for predicting fMRI responses, and analyzing symmetric and asymmetric relationships between models.

It is implemented as part of [CMU 10-733 Course on Representation and Generation in Neuroscience and AI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/10733_S24/).

## Repository Structure
